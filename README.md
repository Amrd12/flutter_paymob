## Flutter Paymob
Flutter Paymob is a library that enables Flutter applications to accept payments through online cards and electronic wallets using the Paymob service.

## :rocket: Installation

Add this to `dependencies` in your app's `pubspec.yaml`

```yaml
flutter_paymob : latest_version
```


## ‚≠ê: Initialization

In your main.dart file, make sure to configure the Flutter Paymob library properly:

```dart
  void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  ...
  FlutterPaymob.instance.initialize(
      apiKey:
      "auth key", //  // from dashboard Select Settings -> Account Info -> API Key 
      integrationID: 123456 , // // from dashboard Select Developers -> Payment Integrations -> Online Card ID 
      walletIntegrationId: 123456, // // from dashboard Select Developers -> Payment Integrations -> Online wallet
      iFrameID: 12346); // from paymob Select Developers -> iframes 
  ...
  runApp(const MyApp());
}
```

> :pushpin: Note :
>
> You can use this singleton (instance)
> or
> Create your own  
> if you want to create different iFrames or integrations
> Alternatively, you can create your own instance:


```dart
final FlutterPaymob flutterPaymob = FlutterPaymob();
  flutterPaymob.initialize(
    apiKey:"auth key",   // from dashboard Select Settings -> Account Info -> API Key 
    integrationID: 123456 , // optional => from dashboard Select Developers -> Payment Integrations -> Online Card ID 
    walletIntegrationId: 123456, // optional => from dashboard Select Developers -> Payment Integrations -> Online wallet
    iFrameID: 12346); // from paymob Select Developers -> iframes 
);
```
